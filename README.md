# Markdown Live Preview

A lightweight Node.js server for live Markdown preview with auto-reload and real-time rendering. View your Markdown files in the browser with instant updates as you edit.

## Why This Tool?

Creating high-quality documentation is essential to modern development workflows, especially as AI-powered tools become integral to how we work. As Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude increasingly generate documentation in Markdown format, we face a common challenge: **seeing exactly how your Markdown documents will render before publishing them**.

Without an efficient preview mechanism, teams often experience a frustrating cycle of editing, committing, checking GitHub's render, and repeating. Markdown Live Preview eliminates this friction by providing instant visual feedback as you edit.

### Perfect for:
- **Working with AI assistants** - Review LLM-generated Markdown instantly
- **README development** - See your formatting as you write
- **Documentation workflows** - Edit in any text editor, preview in real-time
- **Cross-functional teams** - Non-technical contributors can see formatting feedback immediately

## Features

- Real-time Markdown rendering with live reload
- WebSocket-based updates for instant preview
- File watching with automatic change detection
- Copy to Word functionality with formatting preserved
- PDF export with headers and footers
- Clean, responsive UI
- Error handling and connection status indicators

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ComotionLabs/markdown-live-preview.git
cd markdown-live-preview
```

2. Install dependencies:

## Quick Start for Non-Technical Users

Don't worry if you're not a developer! This tool is designed to be easy to use for everyone.

### What You Need
1. **Node.js installed** on your computer ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) - choose the LTS version)
2. **A text editor** - Use whatever you're comfortable with:
   - Notepad (Windows)
   - TextEdit (Mac)
   - VS Code (recommended for both)
   - Any other text editor

### Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1: Get the tool**
1. Download the latest release as a ZIP file from [GitHub](https://github.com/ComotionLabs/markdown-live-preview/releases/latest)
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer
3. Remember where you saved it!

**Step 2: Open your Markdown file**
1. Create or open your `.md` file in your text editor
2. Save it somewhere you can find it

**Step 3: Start the preview**

**On Windows:**
1. Open File Explorer and navigate to where you extracted the tool
2. Hold Shift and right-click in the folder → Select "Open PowerShell window here"
3. Type: `.\preview.bat C:\path\to\your\file.md` (replace with your actual file path)
4. Press Enter

**On Mac:**
1. Open Terminal (search for "Terminal" in Spotlight)
2. Type: `cd ` (with a space after cd)
3. Drag the folder where you extracted the tool into Terminal
4. Press Enter
5. Type: `./preview.sh /path/to/your/file.md` (or drag your .md file into Terminal)

### Common Use Case: Working with ChatGPT/Claude
1. Ask ChatGPT or Claude to generate Markdown documentation
2. Copy the Markdown they provide
3. Paste it into a `.md` file and save it
4. Run the preview tool pointing to that file
5. See how it looks instantly!
6. Ask the AI to refine sections, paste updates, and see changes immediately

### Troubleshooting
- **"Command not found"** - Make sure you installed Node.js and restarted your terminal
- **"File not found"** - Check the path to your Markdown file is correct
- **Browser doesn't open** - Manually open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
- **Need help?** - Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/ComotionLabs/markdown-live-preview/issues)

## Usage

### Quick Start (Recommended)

**Use NPM scripts (works on all platforms):**
```bash
npm run preview yourfile.md
npm run preview yourfile.md 8080  # custom port
```

**Use the shell scripts:**

macOS/Linux:
```bash
./preview.sh yourfile.md
./preview.sh yourfile.md 8080  # custom port
./preview.sh yourfile.md --theme comotion  # use a theme
```

Windows:
```batch
preview.bat yourfile.md
preview.bat yourfile.md 8080
preview.bat yourfile.md --theme comotion  REM use a theme
```

**Use with npx (if published or linked):**
```bash
npx markdown-live-preview yourfile.md
npx markdown-live-preview yourfile.md 8080  # custom port
npx markdown-live-preview yourfile.md --theme comotion  # use a theme
```

**After installing globally:**
```bash
npm install -g .
md-preview yourfile.md
md-preview yourfile.md 8080  # custom port
md-preview yourfile.md --theme comotion  # use a theme
```

### What Happens

1. ✅ Dependencies are automatically checked/installed (shell scripts only)
2. 🚀 Server starts and watches your markdown file
3. 🌐 Browser automatically opens to http://localhost:3000
4. ✏️  Edit your markdown file in any editor
5. 🔄 Preview updates in real-time automatically!

### Manual Usage

If you prefer to run the server directly:

```bash
MARKDOWN_FILE=yourfile.md node server.js
```

**Windows (CMD):**
```batch
set MARKDOWN_FILE=yourfile.md && node server.js
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:MARKDOWN_FILE="yourfile.md"; node server.js
```

**Disable auto-open browser:**
```bash
AUTO_OPEN=false MARKDOWN_FILE=yourfile.md node server.js
```

## Configuration

You can customize the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
./preview.sh yourfile.md 8080
```

Or manually:
```bash
PORT=8080 MARKDOWN_FILE=yourfile.md node server.js
```

### Document Title

The preview uses the first top-level heading in your markdown as the document title. It is shown above the content and used for the browser tab.

Write your title using either format at the very top of the file:

```md
# Your Document Title

Intro text...
```

or Setext style:

```md
Your Document Title
===================

Intro text...
```

That first title line is removed from the content to avoid duplication and appears as the document title element.

### Themes

#### Use a Theme

- Via CLI:
  - `md-preview README.md --theme comotion`
  - `npx markdown-live-preview README.md --theme comotion`
  - `./preview.sh README.md --theme comotion`
  - `preview.bat README.md --theme comotion`
- Via environment variable:
  - `THEME=comotion MARKDOWN_FILE=README.md node server.js`

When a theme is active, its font is applied to the whole document and its logo is rendered at the top of the document content (so it appears when printing). The live preview header remains on-screen but is hidden in print.

#### Add a Theme

1. Create a folder under `themes/<your-theme-name>/`.
2. Place any assets under `themes/<your-theme-name>/assets/` (e.g., logos).
3. Add a `themes/<your-theme-name>/theme.json` with this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "your-theme-name",
  "companyName": "Your Company Name",
  "fontFamily": "Arial, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', sans-serif",
  "logoSrc": "/themes/your-theme-name/assets/your-logo.svg",
  "logoAlt": "Your Brand",
  "titleFontSize": "32px",
  "h1FontSize": "21px",
  "h2FontSize": "18px",
  "h3FontSize": "16px",
  "bodyFontSize": "14px",
  "headingNumbering": true,
  "printFooterEnabled": true,
  "printFooterLabel": "Page",
  "printMargins": { "top": "22mm", "right": "18mm", "bottom": "22mm", "left": "18mm" },
  "sensitivityLevels": {
    "Public": { "bg": "#e7f5ff", "fg": "#0b7285" },
    "Internal": { "bg": "#f1f3f5", "fg": "#343a40" },
    "Confidential": { "bg": "#fff3bf", "fg": "#7f5f01" },
    "Restricted": { "bg": "#ffe3e3", "fg": "#c92a2a" }
  }
}
```

Key fields:
- `companyName`: Appears in the bottom-left of PDF footers
- `logoSrc`: Must be a web path rooted at `/themes/...` (optional)
- `fontFamily`: Applied to the whole document body
- `titleFontSize`: Size of the document title (default: 32px)
- `h1FontSize`: Size of h1 headings (default: 21px)
- `h2FontSize`: Size of h2 headings (default: 18px)
- `h3FontSize`: Size of h3 headings (default: 16px)
- `bodyFontSize`: Size of body text (default: 14px)
- `headingNumbering`: Enables automatic numbering for h1-h3 headings
- `printMargins`: Safe margins for most printers (default: 20mm/15mm)
- `sensitivityLevels`: Maps sensitivity values to header colors in PDFs

### Export Options

#### Copy to Word

- Click the "📋 Copy to Word" button to copy the document in a format optimized for Microsoft Word
- The copied content includes:
  - Document logo (if present in theme)
  - Document title with proper formatting
  - All content with preserved styling
- Simply paste (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V) into Word to maintain formatting
- Works with both modern Clipboard API and fallback methods for older browsers

#### Convert to PDF

- Click the "📄 Export PDF" button for the most accurate result (uses Puppeteer if installed). You can still use your browser's Print dialog as a fallback.
- PDF footers display:
  - **Left side**: Company name (if defined in theme)
  - **Right side**: Page numbering (e.g., "Page 1 of 2")

Theme options for print:
- `companyName`: Company name shown in bottom-left of footer
- `printFooterEnabled`: Whether to show the footer (default true)
- `printFooterLabel`: Label before page numbers (default: "Page")
- `printMargins`: Page margins (default: 20mm top/bottom, 15mm left/right)

Puppeteer (optional):
- This project treats Puppeteer as an optional dependency to keep install size small.
- To enable accurate headers/footers and clean margins in PDFs, install it (Node 18+ required for Puppeteer v24+):
  ```bash
  npm install puppeteer
  ```
- If Puppeteer is not installed, the Export PDF button is hidden. You can still print via your browser menu, but headers/footers may not render correctly.

### Document Metadata

You can add metadata to your documents to control rendering behavior and document classification. Metadata can be specified using either YAML frontmatter or simple inline tags.

#### Sensitivity Classification

Mark your document's sensitivity level for PDF exports (appears in PDF header):

**YAML frontmatter:**
```md
---
sensitivity: Confidential
---

# Your Title
...
```

**Inline format:**
```md
Sensitivity: Confidential

# Your Title
...
```

Common sensitivity levels:
- `Public` - Blue header in PDF
- `Internal` - Gray header in PDF  
- `Confidential` - Yellow header in PDF
- `Restricted` - Red header in PDF

#### Document-Level Theme

Specify which theme to use directly in your document, overriding any command-line theme:

**YAML frontmatter:**
```md
---
theme: comotion
sensitivity: Internal
---

# Your Title
...
```

**Inline format:**
```md
Theme: comotion
Sensitivity: Internal

# Your Title
...
```

Features:
- Document theme overrides command-line `--theme` parameter
- Theme switches dynamically when opening different documents
- Affects fonts, logos, margins, and PDF headers/footers
- Both metadata lines are automatically hidden from rendered output

#### Metadata Processing

- Metadata must appear at the very beginning of the document
- Both `Theme:` and `Sensitivity:` lines are case-insensitive
- Values are trimmed of whitespace
- Inline metadata lines are removed from the rendered content
- Empty lines following metadata are also removed for cleaner output
